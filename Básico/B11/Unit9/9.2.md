## GRAMMAR FOCUS: present tenses in future time clauses

- We use **present** tenses to talk about the future after **when, if, as soon as, before** and **after**.

You will need to book a place **before you come**.  
NOT *... before you will come*

- We use **if** when we are not sure something will happen.  
We use **when** when we are sure.  
We use **when** and **as soon as** to show that one thing will happen immediately after another.

If it rains, they won’t cancel the course.  
When the course finishes, we’ll feel exhausted.

### 1. Use present tenses after time words
We use the **present tense** (not the future tense) after **when, if, as soon as, before** and **after**, even when talking about the future.

**Correct:**  
You will need to book a place **before you come**.

**Incorrect:**  
... *before you will come*

### 2. Use *if* for uncertain situations
We use **if** when we are **not sure** something will happen.

**Example:**  
- If it rains, they won’t cancel the course.

### 3. Use *when* for certain situations
We use **when** when we **are sure** something will happen.

**Example:**  
- When the course finishes, we’ll feel exhausted.
